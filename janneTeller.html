                                <p>Janne Teller's literature, consisting of mainly novels and essays, but also short stories – as well as various works for young adults – always focuses on larger existential perspectives of life and human civilization and
                                    often sparks controversial and heated debates. She has received many literary awards, and her work is translated over 25 languages.[1] Janne Teller's novels cover a wide variety of contemporary and philosophical issues.[2]
                                    They include the highly praised modern Nordic saga Odin's Island (1999), dealing with religious and political fanaticism; Europa (2004), about European identity and the binds of history in love and war; and Come (2008),
                                    about ethics in art and modern life. Her essays cover existential and ethical perspectives of modern life, and include 'Between the Lines' (Lettre International, 2012), "Europe, who do you want to be?" (Die Welt, 2012)
                                    and 'Little Brother is watching you' (Cicero, 2010). She's furthermore thought to have revolutionized the young adult novel with her existential Nothing (Danish Intet), first published in Denmark in 2000, earned critical
                                    acclaim and caused widespread controversy in Scandinavia.[3] It was initially banned,[citation needed] but has since risen as an international bestseller and is today considered a neo-classic by numerous critics worldwide.
                                    The novel's main character, the boy Pierre Anthon, proclaims to his classmates that life is meaningless, sitting in a plum tree. They feel an urge to show Pierre Anthon some proof that there is meaning in life, which
                                    ultimately leads to violence amongst the children.</p>
